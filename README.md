# Filesend

Filesend is a simple way to share files with others.

## Files

## Sessions

Filesend doesn't hold any user information beyond a user's email address. Log in is handled with magic link authentication. The `/session` route handles the following:

1. Emailing a link using `node-mailer`
2. Convert the link token to an authentication and refresh token pair
3. Delete session, logging the user out.
4. Refresh session with refresh token

Tokens are signed with asymmetric keys.
After a session is deleted, the user's refresh token will no longer work. This is handled using a session record per email address.

### Token rules

1. Links can only be used once. A link expires after 15 minutes.
2. A link token can only be redeemed if the email address it was sent with is provided as well
3. A refresh token can only be used once. A new refresh token will be issued on refresh.
4. An auth token expires in 15 minutes
5. Deleting a session invalidates any current refresh tokens. The client is expected to delete its auth token.
6. The refresh token is stored in a secure (secure, sameSite, httpOnly, domain and path set) cookie
7. The auth token should be stored in browser memory (ie react state). Use localstorage events to trigger log out across multiple windows. It should never actually be stored in LocalStorage
